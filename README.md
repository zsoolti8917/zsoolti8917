### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page! My name is Zsolt VarjÃº, and I am currently studying applied informatics in Slovakia while working as a visual web tester. In my current role, I review websites for cities and organizations, identify any discrepancies between the design files, and communicate revisions to frontend developers. As a result, I have developed a keen eye for identifying and troubleshooting problems in HTML and CSS.

My experience in this position has fueled my interest in frontend development, and I am currently learning SCSS and React. I enjoy working on 3D projects and modeling, and when I am not coding, you can find me skiing down a mountain slope.

Working in a fully remote position has taught me how to communicate effectively through email and Slack while meeting strict deadlines. I am excited to share my projects and collaborate with other developers on Github, so please feel free to take a look around and connect with me.
