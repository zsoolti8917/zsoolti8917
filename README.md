### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Zsolt VarjÃº, a graduate in Applied Informatics from Slovakia, currently working as a Visual Web Tester. In my role, I review websites for cities and organizations, identifying discrepancies between design files and actual web pages, and communicating revisions to frontend developers. This experience has sharpened my ability to identify and troubleshoot issues in HTML and CSS.

My work has ignited a passion for frontend development, and I'm now focusing on Next.js and headless CMS projects to create full-stack, user-friendly webpages where clients can edit their websites and even create new pages. I love tackling 3D projects and modeling, and when Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me skiing down a mountain slope.

Working remotely has honed my communication skills, helping me effectively coordinate through email and Slack while meeting strict deadlines. I'm eager to share my projects and collaborate with other developers here on GitHub. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on freelance projects, which I add to my portfolio to expand my skills and knowledge.
- ðŸŒ± Always learning through projects, currently using Headless CMS and Next.js.
